# Thinkful
Certified in cybersecurity

I recently completed the Thinkful Certified in Cybersecurity program, which provided me with a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles, hands-on experience with security tools, and industry-relevant knowledge to prepare for an entry-level role in the field.

Key Areas of Learning:
1. IT Security Fundamentals
 -Gained an understanding of core cybersecurity concepts, including CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and security frameworks.
 -Learned about common attack vectors (phishing, malware, DDoS, SQL injection) and how to mitigate them.
 -Explored networking basics (TCP/IP, OSI model, firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs) and how they relate to security.
 -Understood risk management, compliance standards (NIST, ISO 27001, HIPAA), and security best practices.

2. Security Analyst Skills
 -Learned threat detection and monitoring using tools like Wireshark and SIEM systems.
 -Conducted vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify security weaknesses.
 -Explored incident response procedures, including how to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.
 -Practiced log analysis and forensics techniques to investigate potential cyber threats.

3. Advanced Security and Specialization
 -Gained experience with endpoint security, encryption, and secure authentication methods (MFA, PKI).
 -Explored cloud security principles (AWS, Azure security tools, shared responsibility model).
 -Learned about identity and access management (IAM), role-based access control (RBAC), and security policies.
 -Developed security policies and participated in simulated cyberattacks to understand real-world defense strategies.

4. Practical Hands-on Training
 -Completed hands-on labs using virtual environments to simulate real cybersecurity scenarios.
 -Worked on a capstone project, where I applied all learned concepts to secure an IT infrastructure.
 -Used industry-standard tools like Splunk, Kali Linux, Wireshark, and Nessus to detect and mitigate threats.

This program gave me a well-rounded technical skill set and practical experience to prepare for a role in cybersecurity, whether as a Security Analyst, SOC Analyst, or IT Security Specialist. Iâ€™m now confident in securing networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and responding to incidents effectively. Plus, the exposure to industry frameworks and best practices makes me better prepared for certifications like CompTIA Security+ or Certified in Cybersecurity (CC).
